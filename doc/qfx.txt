INTRODUCTION                                    *qfx*

This plugin automatically shows signs in place after quickfix commands.  This
is useful for people who do not like using automatic linters like |ale.vim| or
|syntastic|.  It integrates quite well with |asyncdo| and propably other
asynchronous |:make| runners.

FUNCTIONS                                       *qfx-functions*

qfx#place()                                     *qfx#place()*
                 Place signs on lines in |getqflist()|.

qfx#clear()                                     *qfx#clear()*
                 Clear previously set signs.
